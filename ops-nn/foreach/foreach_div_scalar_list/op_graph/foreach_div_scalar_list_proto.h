/**
 * @brief Apply division operation for each tensor in tensor list with a list of scalar in manner
 * of element-wise the number of tensors in tensor list shall be equal to the number of scalars
 * in scalar list.
 * @par Inputs:
 * Two inputs:
 * @li x: A tensor list containing multiple tensors, the length cannot exceed 50,
 *        the dtype can be BFloat16, Float16 or Float32, and the format support ND.
 * @li scalars: A scalar list in form of tensor with only multiple elements,
 *        the dtype can be Float32, and the format supports ND.
 * @par Outputs:
 * A tensor list which store the tensors whose value are x divide by the scalars in scalar list,
 *       has the same length, dtype and format as input "x".
