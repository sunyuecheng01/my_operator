 * @brief Detect whether there is Inf or Nan in scaled_grads, set found_inf to 1 if it exists,
 * and do not operate on found_inf if it does not. Finally, multiply all values of scaled_grads by inv_scale
 * @par Inputs:
 * Three inputs:
 * @li scaled_grads: A tensor list containing multiple tensors, format supports ND, can be float16, float, bfloat16,
 * maximum length of scaled_grads is 256,
 * meanwhile, this value is also an output, store the value multiplied by inv_scale.
 * @li found_inf: A single-element float tensor to which 1.0 will be written if any scaled_grad contain infs/nans,
 * with only one element, format supports ND, must be float,
 * meanwhile, this value is also an output, indicating whether there is Inf or Nan present.
 * @li inv_scale: A single-element float tensor by which scaled_grads are currently multiplied,
 * with only one element, format supports ND, must be float.
