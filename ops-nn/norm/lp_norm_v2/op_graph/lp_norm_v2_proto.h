/**
* @brief Computes Lp norm.

* @par Inputs:
* x: A ND tensor of dtype float16, bfloat16, float32.
*
* @par Attributes:
* @li p: An optional float, "inf" or "-inf", indicates the order of norm. Default is 2.0.
* @li axes: ListInt, an optional attribute, indicates dimensions over which to compute the norm.
* Default is {}, meaning all axes will be computed.
* @li keepdim: An optional bool. If set to true, the reduced dimensions are retained in the result
* as dimensions with size one. Default is false.
* @li epsilon: An optional float. A value added to the denominator for numerical stability. Default is 1e-12.

* @par Outputs:
* y: A ND tensor has the same dtype as "x". The shape of "y" is depending on "axes" and "keepdim".

* @attention Constraints:
* @li When the attribute "p" is negative, there may be precision difference in the calculation results.
* @li When the attribute "axes" is specified as the axis with a shape dimension value of 1 in the input tensor,
* there may be precision difference in the calculation results.
* @li When the tensor "x" is empty and "p" < 0 or "p" is infinity, we cannot reduce the whole tensor or reduce
* over an empty dimension.

* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with the Pytorch operator LpNorm.
