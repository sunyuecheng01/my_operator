/**
* @brief Multiplies matrix "a" by matrix "b", producing "a @ b". \n
* @par Inputs:
* Four inputs, including:
* @li x1: A matrix tensor. Must be one of the following types:
* float32, float16, bfloat16. 3D. Has format ND.
* @li x2: A matrix tensor. Must be one of the following types:
* float32, float16, bfloat16. 3D. Has format ND.
* @li bias: An optional tensor. Bias for batchmatmul. Must be one of the following types:
* float32, float16, bfloat16. 1D. Has format ND.
* @li scale: A matrix tensor, quantization parameter.
             Must be one of the following types: uint64, int64. The format
             supports ND. The shape is 1D (t,), with t equal to b*n, where b, n is the same as that of x2.

* @par Attributes:
* Four attributes, including:
* @li perm_x1: A list int. "x1" is permuted to shape [B, M, K] before multiplication, the default value is no permutation.
* @li perm_x2: A list int. "x2" is permuted to shape [B, K, N] before multiplication, the default value is no permutation.
* @li perm_y: A list int. "y" is permuted after multiplication.
* @li enable_hf32: An optional bool. If True, enable enable_hi_float_32_execution.
* @li batch_split_factor: An optional int. Declares factor of output_batch. Default to be 1.

* @par Outputs:
* y: The result matrix tensor. 3D. Must be one of the following
* types: float32, float16, int8, bfloat16. 3D. Has format ND. \n
