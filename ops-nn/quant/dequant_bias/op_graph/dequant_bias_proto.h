* @brief DequantBias. \n

* @par Inputs:
* @li x: A 2D tensor. Input tensor representing the inverse quantization operation.
* Supported format "ND". The shape is [M, N], and the data type supports int32.
* @li weight_scale: A 1D tensor. Indicates the weight of the multiplication on the N-dimensional input of the anti-quantization operation.
* The shape is [N], and the length is consistent with the N-dimensional length of x. The data type supports float32, bfloat16.
* @li activate_scale: A 1D tensor. The data type supports float32.
* Indicates the weight of the multiplication on the M dimension of the input for the anti-quantization operation.
* The shape is [M], with a length consistent with the M dimension of x, and the data type supports float32.
* Supported format "ND".
* @li bias: A 1D tensor. Indicates the weight of the addition on the N-dimensional input of the anti-quantization operation.
* The shape is [N], with a length consistent with the N-dimensional length of x.
* The data type supports float32, bfloat16, float16, int32. Supported format "ND".

* @par Attributes:
* output_dtype: An int attr. Indicates the data type of the output out. The value is [1, 27].
* A value of 1 indicates that the output type is float16, and a value of 27 indicates that the output type is bfloat16.
* When the weight_scale data type is float32, this parameter is set to 1; when the weight_scale data type is bfloat16,
* this parameter is set to 27.

* @par Outputs:
* y: A 2D tensor. The output tensor of the quantization operation.
* The shape is [M, N], and the data type supports float16, bfloat16. Supported format "ND". \n
