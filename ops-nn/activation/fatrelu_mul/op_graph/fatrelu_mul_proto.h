* @brief FatreluMul divides the input tensor into left and right tensors x1 and x2 based on the last dimension,
* performs Threshold calculation on x1 on the left, and multiplies the calculation result by x2. \n

* @par Inputs:
* @li x: A tensor of type float, float16 or bfloat16. Shape support 2D ~ 8D.
* The format must be ND.
* @li threshold: A scalar, type is float, used to set the threshold of "x".

* @par Outputs:
* y: A tensor has the same type and format as "x".
* Other dimensions of its shape are the same as those of "x".
* The value of the last dimension is half the value of the last dimension of "x". \n
