/**
* @brief Reduces "x" along the dimensions according to "axis".

* @par Inputs:
* Two inputs, including:
* @li x: A tensor. Must be one of the following types:
*complex128, complex64, double, float32, float16, int64, int32, int16, int8,
*uint64, uint32, uint16, uint8, bfloat16. The data format supports ND.
* @li axes: The dimensions to reduce. Must be one of the following types:
* int, list, tuple, NoneType. Data type must be int32 or int64.
* If None (the default), reduces all dimensions.
* Must be in the range [-rank(x), rank(x)).

* @par Attributes:
* @li keep_dims: An optional bool. Defaults to false.
* If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1.
* If false, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each entry in axis.
* @li noop_with_empty_axes: An optional bool. Defaults to true.
* If true, when axes = [], not reduce.
* If false, when axes = [], reduce all.
* @par Outputs:
* y: A tensor. Has the same type and format as "x".

* @attention Constraints:
* @li When converting ONNX to OM, if the axes of the ReduceMean operator is empty,
   and noop_with_empty_axes is true, it is recommended to use the mean function with dim explicitly
   set to all axes(e.g., dim=[0, 1, 2]) to prevent shape inference errors.

* @par Third-party framework compatibility:
* Compatible with the TensorFlow operator ReduceMean.
