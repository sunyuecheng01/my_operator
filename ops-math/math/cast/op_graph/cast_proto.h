*@brief Cast a tensor form src data type to dst data type.

*@par Inputs:
*One input:
* x:A ND or 5HD tensor. Support 1D~8D. Must be one of the following types: bool, float16, float, int8, int32, uint32, uint8, bfloat16, uint1,
   int64, uint64, int16, uint16, double, complex32, complex64, complex128, qint8, quint8, qint16, quint16, qint32,
   hifloat8, float8_e5m2, float8_e4m3fn, float4_e1m2, float4_e2m1.

*@par Attributes:
*dst_type: A required attribute of type int32, specifying the dst data type.

*@par Outputs:
*y:A ND Tensor with same shape as x, and data type is specified by dst_type.

*@attention Constraints:
* @li In the scenario where the data type is converted from float16 to int16: \n
*     If the input data contains inf, inf is converted into the maximum value of int16. \n
*     If the input data contains -inf, -inf is converted into the minimum value of int16. \n
* @li In the scenarios where the data type is converted from INT32 to INT8: \n
*     It can only guarantee that the input data has no precision errors within the range of (-2048, 1920).
* @li Atlas Inference Series Product in the scenarios where the data type is converted from FLOAT32 to INT8: \n
*     It can only guarantee that the input data has no precision errors within the range of (-2048, 1920).
* @li Atlas Inference Series Product in the scenarios where the data type is converted from FLOAT32 to INT64 and from FLOAT32 to UINT8: \n
*     It can only guarantee that the input data has no precision errors within the range of (-2147483648, 2147483583).
* @li Atlas Inference Series Product in the scenarios where the data type is converted from INT64 to FLOAT32: \n
*     It can only guarantee that the input data has no precision errors within the range of (-2147483648, 2147483647).
* @li Ascend 910_95 AI Processor in the scenario where the data type is converted from INT32 to INT4: \n
*     The last dim of x must be an even number.
