/**
*@brief  Reduce a tensor on a certain axis based on product.

*@par Inputs:
*Two inputs, including:
*@li x: A Tensor. Must be the type of NumberType.(NumberType
*includes: complex128, complex64, double, float32, float16, int16,
*int32, int64,int8, qint32, qint8, quint8, uint16, uint32, uint64,
*uint8, bfloat16, complex32).Supported format list ["ND"].
*@li axes: A Tensor. Must be the type of IndexNumberType(
*includes: int32, int64). The dimensions to reduce.Supported format list ["ND"]. \n

*@par Attributes:
*keep_dims: A bool. If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1.
*Optional and defaults to "False" . \n
* noop_with_empty_axes: An optional bool. Defaults to "true" .
* - If true, when axes = [], not reduce.
* - If false, when axes = [], reduce all.
* This attribute is valid only for Ascend910_95 AI Processors and later products.

*@par Outputs:
*y: A Tensor. Has the same type and format as input "x" . \n

*@par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with the TensorFlow operator ReduceProd.
