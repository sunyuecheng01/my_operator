 * @brief Compute element-wise finiteness, return a boolean tensor.

 * @par Inputs:
 * x: An ND tensor. Support 1D ~ 8D. Must be one of the following types:
 * bfloat16, float16, float32, double, bool, uint8, int8, uint16, int16, int32, uint32, uint64, int64.

 * @par Outputs:
 * y: An ND tensor. Support 1D ~ 8D. Must have the same shape and format as input "x", and dytpe is bool.

 * @par Third-party framework compatibility.
 * Compatible with tensorflow IsFinite operator.
