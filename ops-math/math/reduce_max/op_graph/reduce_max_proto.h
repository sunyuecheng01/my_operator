/**
* @brief Returns the maximum of elements across dimensions of a Tensor .

* @par Inputs:
* Two inputs, including:
* @li x: A multi-dimensional Tensor of Must be the type of NumberType. Supported format list ["ND"]
* @li axes: A Scalar of type in IndexNumberType(IndexNumberType includes the
  following types: int32, int64.), specifying the axes information
  of the index with the maximum value. Supported format list ["ND"] \n

* @par Attributes:
* keep_dims: A bool, specifying whether to keep dimensions for the output Tensor.
* Optional and defaults to "false". \n
* noop_with_empty_axes: An optional bool. Defaults to "true" .
* - If true, when axes = [], not reduce.
* - If false, when axes = [], reduce all.
* This attribute is valid only for Ascend910_95 AI Processors and later products.

* @par Outputs:
* y: A multi-dimensional Tensor, specifying the maximum value of the
  corresponding axis in the tensor.
  Has the same type as "x". (If "keep_dims" is set to "false",
  the output dimensions are reduced by "dimension" compared with that of "x".
  Otherwise, the output has one fewer dimension than "x").Supported format list ["ND"]

* @attention Constraints:
* @li The value range of "axes" is [-dims, dims - 1]. "dims"
  indicates the dimension length of "x".
* @li When converting ONNX to OM, if the axes of the ReduceMax operator is empty,
   it is recommended to use the amax function with dim explicitly set to all axes
   (e.g., dim=[0, 1, 2]) to prevent shape inference errors.

* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with TensorFlow operator Max.
