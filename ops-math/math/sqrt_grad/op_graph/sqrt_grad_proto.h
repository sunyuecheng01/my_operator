* @brief Computes the gradient of the square root of "x" with regard to its

* input gradient. Support broadcasting operations.

* @par Inputs:
* Two inputs, including:
* @li y: A ND Tensor of type of UnaryDataType. Must be one of the following types: float64,
* float16, float32, complex128, complex64.
* @li dy: A ND Tensor. Has the same dtype as "y". \n

* @par Outputs:
* z: A ND Tensor. Has the same dtype as "y". \n

* @attention Constraints:
* "dy" has the same shape and type as "y".
