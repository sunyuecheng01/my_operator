/**
* @brief Computes the sum of elements across dimensions of a tensor.

* @par Inputs:
* Two inputs, including:
* @li x: A tensor. Must be one of the following types:
* complex128, complex64, double, float32, float16, int16, int32, int64,
* int8, qint32, qint8, quint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uint8, bfloat16,
* complex32.
* @li axes: A 1D list or tuple of IndexNumberType(int32 or int64).
* Specifies the dimensions to reduce.

* @par Attributes:
* keep_dims: An optional bool. If "true", retains reduced dimensions with
* length 1. Defaults to "false".
* noop_with_empty_axes: An optional bool. Defaults to "true" .
* - If true, when axes = [], not reduce.
* - If false, when axes = [], reduce all.
* This attribute is valid only for Ascend910_95 AI Processors and later products.

* @par Outputs:
* y: The reduced tensor. Has the same type and format as input "x".

* @attention Constraints:
* @li The value range of "axes" is [-dims, dims - 1]. "dims"
  indicates the dimension length of "x".
* @li When converting ONNX to OM, if the axes of the ReduceSum operator is empty,
   it is recommended to use the sum function with dim explicitly set to all axes
   (e.g., dim=[0, 1, 2]) to prevent shape inference errors.

* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with the TensorFlow operator Sum.
