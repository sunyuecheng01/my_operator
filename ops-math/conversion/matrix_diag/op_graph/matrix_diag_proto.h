/**
* @brief Returns a batched diagonal tensor with a given batched diagonal values . \n

* @par Inputs:
* x: A Tensor. Must be one of the following types:
*   double, float32, float16, bfloat16, complex32, complex64, complex128,
*   int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64, qint8, quint8, qint16, quint16, qint32, 
*   hifloat8, float8_e5m2, float8_e4m3fn, bool. \n

* @par Outputs:
* y: A Tensor. Has the same type as "x". \n

* @attention Constraints:
* @li If x is an n-dimensional tensor, y has dimensions of n+1, and the first n dimensions of y are equal to the 
* first n dimensions of x, and the last dimension of y is consistent with the last dimension of x. \n

* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with the TensorFlow operator MatrixDiag.
