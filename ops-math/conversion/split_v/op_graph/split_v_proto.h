/**
* @brief Splits a tensor along dimension "split_dim" into "num_split"
  smaller tensors according to "size_splits" .

* @par Inputs:
* Three inputs, including:
* @li x: An ND Tensor.
* Must be one of the types:float16, float32, double, int64, int32, uint8,
  uint16, uint32, uint64, int8, int16, bool, complex64, complex128, qint8,
  quint8, qint16, quint16, qint32, string, bfloat16.
* @li size_splits: Must be one of the IndexNumberType:int32, int64.
  Specifies a list containing the sizes of each output tensor along the split dimension.
  The elements in "size_splits" sum to the size of dimension "split_dim".
* @li split_dim: Must be the following type:int32, int64. Specifies the
  dimension along which to split. Must be in the range [-len(x.shape), len(x.shape)) . \n

* @par Attributes:
* @li num_split: A required int includes all types of int. Specifies the number of output tensors.
  No default value . \n

* @par Outputs:
* @li y:  Dynamic output.A list of output tensors.
  Has the same type and format as "x" . \n

* @attention Constraints:
* @li Each element in "size_splits" is greater than or equal to 1.
* @li The length of "size_splits" is equal to the value of "num_split".
* @li The elements in "size_splits" sum to the size of dimension "split_dim" . \n

* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with the TensorFlow operator SplitV.
