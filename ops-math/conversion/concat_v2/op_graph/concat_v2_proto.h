* @brief Concatenates tensors along one dimension .

* @par Inputs:
* Two inputs, including:
* @li Dynamic input "x" is A ND Tensor.
* Must be one of the following types: bfloat16, float16, float32, double, int32,
*     uint8, int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, uint16,
*     complex128, uint32, uint64, qint16, quint16, bool, string.
* @li concat_dim: A 0D Tensor (scalar) with dtype int32, or int64. Specifies the dimension along which to concatenate . \n

* @par Attributes:
* N: An optional int includes all types of int.
* Specifies the number of elements in "x". Defaults to "1". \n

* @par Outputs:
* y: A Tensor. Has the same type and format as "x" . \n

* @attention Constraints:
* "x" is a list of at least 2 "tensor" objects of the same type . \n

* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with the TensorFlow operator ConcatV2.
