/**
* @brief Broadcasts an array for a compatible shape.
*  Broadcasting is the process of making arrays to have compatible shapes
*  for arithmetic operations. Two shapes are compatible if for each
*  dimension pair they are either equal or one of them is one. When trying
*  to broadcast a Tensor to a shape, it starts with the trailing dimensions,
*  and works its way forward.
*
* @par Inputs:
* @li x: A tensor, support all dtype include(BasicType, bool, string, hifloat8, float8_e5m2, float8_e4m3fn).
* @li shape: A tensor.
*     A 1D tensor of type int32 or int64, for the shape of the desired output.
*
* @par Outputs:
* y: A tensor. Has the same tensor info of "x".
*
* @par Third-party framework compatibility
* Compatible with the TensorFlow operator BroadcastTo.
