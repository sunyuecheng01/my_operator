*@brief Outputs random values from a uniform distribution. \n

*@par Inputs:
*Inputs include:
*@li shape: A 1-D Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. The shape of the output tensor.
*@li offset: A 1-D Tensor， should be const data. Must be one of the following types: int64. \n

*@par Attributes:
*@li dtype: An required int. The data type of y. It supports 1(float16), 27(bfloat16) and 0(float32).
*@li seed: An optional int. Defaults to 0. If either seed or seed2 are set to be non-zero, 
the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded by a random seed.
*@li seed2: An optional int. Defaults to 0 . A second seed to avoid seed collision. \n

*@par Outputs:
*@li y: A Tensor of type float32, float16, bfloat16.
*@li offset: A 1-D Tensor， should be const data. Must be one of the following types: int64. \n
